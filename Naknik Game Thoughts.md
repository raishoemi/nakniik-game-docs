### Linear Difficulty Increasing
- Kingdom requirements should naturally, linearly increase.
	- Should you fail to answer the kingdom's demands you will be executed
	- **MUST:** Players abilities to handle additional requirements should increase (How?)
### Suspicion
- As you get closer to overthrowing the king, he begins to suspect
- Can be hidden. Not a mechanism the player's aware of, but one that the game generates content based off of. For instance, you do something fishy, so the king asks you for more because he suspects you. But not you do something fishy, so the meter goes up.

## Lose Condition
The following is the "suspicion lose condition". It's not in the game at the moment, but we'd like to insert it somehow as it makes a lot of sense intuitively:
	At  the moment  I've defined "lose  condition" as the king realizing you're trying to overthrow him and exiles/kills/removes you.
	**Intuition** - outside game aspects, it makes sense that if you're trying to undermine someone they may get a whiff of what you're trying to do and stop you.

The other "main" lose condition is reaching 3 strikes. You get a strike when you fail to fulfil a kingdom official's request.

## Encounter
* Every encounter should have: **accept** and **decline** options.
* Should also include a bargain option (generated randomly based off of previous decisions)
	* What are the downsides of bargain?
* When you start an encounter you can choose who visits you (yes)

## Bargains
- Bargains success rates can be influenced by previous choices.
- Bargains are always 

## Encounter List
We should consider how much information to give out on the encounters every day.
The way I see it - there's the encounter row at the top of the screen (like in TFT)

And for every "hour" (day-part) you can choose one of three options on who to meet with - here there's also the question on what information is given out before the encounter begins.
Information could include:
- Encounter type (royal, citizen)
- Encounter rarity
- Encounter special bargains available / Favors available
- (if royal) - minimal cost
