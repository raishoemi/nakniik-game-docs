# Description
In a remote kingdom, you serve as the king's advisor, navigating daily encounters with kingdom officials and citizens whose requests shape your path.
### Win Condition
- You win when you've built a coalition to overthrow the king
### Lose Condition
- You lose when you fail to fulfil a kingdom official's request 3 times
# Lingo
- Council-member/Minister/Royal Appointee/Kingdom Official (WIP, need to decide on one name) - these are names for king-appointed people whose requests you're expected to fulfil.
- Citizen: any non-royal person
- Favor - a "victory point". Reaching 10 (number undecided) favors wins the game.
	- Do not use the word "Favor" for non-victory point things. If we do, we need to reconsider the word "Favor".
